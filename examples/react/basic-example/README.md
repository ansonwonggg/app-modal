# Basic Example

This is a basic example on how `React App Modal` works. Simply run `npm run dev` and you can start the application. You can input your name in the input box and click "Say Hello". You should see a modal pop up in the middle.

You can also use "Profile" from "React Developer Tools" to see on the performance.
