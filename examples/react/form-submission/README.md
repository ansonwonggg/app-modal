# Form Submission Example

It is an example of a form submission. By typing username and password, you can try to login. If you input "admin" for both username and password, you should see a success message, otherwise an error message dialog. There is a 3 seconds mocking loading to simulate actual behavior.

You can also use "Profile" from "React Developer Tools" to see on the performance.
